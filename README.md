# coursera-course4-module2-solution
This is the solution for coursera html, css, js course by jhon's hopkins.
It's a simple project, a single responsive web page, using only html, and css3.
I used simple css3 tricks to make it look good on all platforms, I used media quieres and relaive positioning to achieve it.
